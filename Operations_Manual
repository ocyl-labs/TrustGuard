Subject: Preventing fraud cost for [Company Name]

[FirstName],

I noticed [Company] does ~$[Volume]/year on eBay.

Quick question: How much are you losing to:
- Fraudulent buyers?
- Payment disputes?
- Counterfeit returns?

Most eBay businesses we work with lose 3-7% to fraud.
For you, that's potentially $[Calculation]/year.

TrustGuard Enterprise protects [ClientName] and [ClientName2] 
(similar volume to you) - they've cut fraud losses by 94%.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

"Thanks for taking the time. I'm [Name] from OCYL Digital Labs, 
the team behind TrustGuard. We help eBay businesses like yours

OBJECTION HANDLING
---
"Too expensive"
→ "I understand. Let me show you the math: If TrustGuard prevents 
just ONE $2,500 fraud incident this year, it pays for itself. 
Based on your volume, we typically prevent 15-20 incidents. 
The question isn't cost, it's 'can you afford NOT to have this?'"

"We already have someone checking manually"
→ "That's actually common. Quick question: How long does manual 
verification take per listing? [Wait] And how accurate are they? 
[Wait] Our AI does it in 0.24 seconds at 99.2% accuracy. Even 
if you keep your team, TrustGuard acts as a safety net for the 
cases they miss. Worth having that protection?"

"Need to think about it"
→ "Absolutely. What specific concerns do you need to think through? 
[Address directly] How about this: Start the 30-day trial while 
you think. No credit card needed. If it doesn't prevent at least 
ONE fraud incident in 30 days, I'll personally refund any setup 
costs. Fair?"
